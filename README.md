# Signal Processing Essentials 
## Content
This repository consists of notebooks of different topics in Signal Processing, Including 
- Time-series Denoising
- Spectral and Rhythmic Analysis
- Filtering 
- Convolution
- Wavelet Analysis
- Resampling, Interpolating and Extrapolation
- Outlier Detection
- and Feature Detection

## Program Language and Requirements
All the codes are written in Python, using Jupyter notebook, and numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas as relevant libraries. 

## Contribution and Authorship   
The codes are originally authered by [**Mike X Cohen**](https://www.mikexcohen.com/), based on his [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/signal-processing/). 

All contributions welcome! Please do not forget to star this code and also referring to the original course.
